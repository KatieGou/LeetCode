dp[i] means the total profits that can be gained till day i.

There are two cases:

Case 1:
prices[i]>prices[i-1]. Then the profit will be the profit till day i-1 plus the difference between prices[i] and prices[i-1]

Case 2:
prices[i]<=prices[i-1]. Then the profit till day i will remain the same as it is on day i-1.
