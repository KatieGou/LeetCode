Add 0 to the end of the list to ensure it is the smaller or equal to other heights. 
Iterate the list and store the index in a stack. If the current height is smaller than the previous height, pause and calculate area and update max area. (In this process, if the 
stack is empty, it means the current height is the lowest value that has been met).
