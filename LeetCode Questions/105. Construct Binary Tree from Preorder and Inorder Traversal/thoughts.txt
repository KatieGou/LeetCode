Very hard question. 

Preorder: root, left, right
Inorder: left, root, right

So each item in preorder is a root. Iterate preorder, get the root value and split inorder based on it to get the left subtree and the right subtree. Use a recursive function to 
build the tree recursively by limiting the left and the right range of inorder. 

New knowledge: nonlocal keyword in Python:
To declare that the variable is not local. Used to work with variables inside nested functions, where the variable should not belong to the inner function.
