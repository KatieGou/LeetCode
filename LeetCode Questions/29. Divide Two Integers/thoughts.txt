I used accumulation with 2-to-the-power i to check whether the result has reached the dividend. Eg. if the input is 20 and 3, then 20=3*(2^2 + 2^1)+2, the result is (2^2 + 2^1)=6.

current_res stores the value achieved so far, and exp_lst stores the list of exponents. 

Make sure the distance to dividend is larger or euqal to the value achieved. Update current_res and exp_lst at each iteration.
