Except the 'O's connected to the edges of the board, all other 'O's should be replaced by 'X'. 
The dfs(r, c) function is to change all 'O' that are connected to cell (r, c) to 'U', meaning that they should be unchanged. 
For each cell on the edges, dfs function is called. 
Finally, change all 'O's to 'X', and change all 'U's back to 'O'.
