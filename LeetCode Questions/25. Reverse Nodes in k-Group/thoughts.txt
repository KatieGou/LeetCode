Reverse the listnode sub by sub. If there are less than k nodes left, reverse back.

At the first iteration, set the output to prev. 

Important!! 
reversed_listnode.next points to the same reference as output. When updating the reversed_listnode in the else statement, output is also updated. 

Think more about it
