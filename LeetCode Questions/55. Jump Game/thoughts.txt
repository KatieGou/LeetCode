Dynamic programming.

dp[i] means whether index i can be reached or not. 

Update dp[i] according to max_reach_idx. The indices before max_reach_idx can be updated to True.

Check dp[-1] in each iteration. 

New knowledge: When update a part of a list, the expression after the '=' should be an iterable.

Eg. lst[:3]=[1]*3
